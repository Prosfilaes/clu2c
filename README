CLU2C Version 1.99.4                                  November 24, 2024

This version of CLU2C has been tested on the following platform:
Linux/x86 with gcc-11. It is known not to work on Linux/AMD64 because
of the assumption that integer size is the same as pointer size. I am
mainly concerned about Linux on x86-64, ARM32, ARM64 (Raspberry Pis),
and RISC-V 64. In theory, I'd like it to run on Mac OS X and various
BSDs, but am unlikely to work on that myself. DOS support is being
removed, unless there's active demand, and I'm not in any rush to
support Windows or work around bugs in proprietary Unixes.

Changes to this release include updating autoconfig, requiring
external libgc, and removing support for legacy Japanese encodings
that wasn't compiling for modern glibc. Immediate work is going
to be aimed at making it work on AMD64, which I hope will bring along
support for all 64 bit Linux architectures.


CLU2C Version 1.99.3 (2.0-beta3)		      February 6, 1997

CLU2C is a portable implementation of the programming language CLU.
Portability has been achieved by (1) translating CLU to C, using the C
compiler of each of the machines as an "assembler"; (2) writing the
runtime routines entirely in CLU and C; and (3) using the conservative
GC package by Boehm, et al.  CLU is an object-based imperative
language featuring data abstraction, strong typing, parametric
polymorphism, exception handling, and iterators.  This distribution
package contains a CLU compiler, a runtime system including
implementations of the built-in types and the built-in type
generators, and some library modules including basic I/O modules
described in CLU Reference Manual.  Most of the source code is written
in CLU itself, but a CLU compiler is not needed for compiling CLU2C
since pre-translated C source files are included in the source
distribution package.

CLU2C is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the particular terms and conditions.  See the file COPYING for more
detail.  Part of this software has been derived from PCLU and the
conservative GC package.  See the files COPYRIGHT.PCLU and
lib/gc/README.gc for the copying conditions for PCLU and the
conservative GC package, respectively.

See the file INSTALL or INSTALL.ja (a Japanese translation of INSTALL)
for the installation instructions.

Currently CLU2C has been tested out successfully for the following
platforms.
