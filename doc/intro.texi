@chapter Introduction

CLU2C is an implementation of the programming language CLU.
More specifically,
it is a CLU compiler with some basic library modules.

The basic strategy is to translate CLU to C.
As you might be aware,
the name CLU2C stands for `CLU to C'.

This manual does not describe CLU itself,
although we assume you have some basic knowledge about CLU.
See @cite{CLU Reference Manual} for the language definition.

We use @samp{@r{CLU2C}} to denote the whole language system.
We use @code{clu2c} to denote the compiler.
